            <h2> It is my calling to collaborate with a team of creatives and help bring amazing content to the world. I enjoy building interactive 
                worlds full of excitement and fantastic stories. I have been writing tabletop campaigns as a hobby and for volunteer work
                for 7 years. As that passion grew, so did my interest in video games, and my curiosity about UI and UX began. How does one
                incorporate a narrative or branding into the UI and enhance user experience? With my flexible communicative approach to 
                customizing narratives, I am always ready to incorporate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and offer constructive feedback 
                in the design process to do just that. Mastering empathetic communication is my greatest achievement. Incorporating and 
                teaching those skills allows for free utilization of constructive feedback. Creating that kind of cohesion and understanding 
                among professionals results in a work culture that essentially says, "we're all in this together; let's grow together and 
                create something to be proud of." </h2>
